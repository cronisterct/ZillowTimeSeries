# ZillowTimeSeries
In this project, I worked with two classmates, Max Shinnerl and Yueling Wu. Together we explored a Zillow dataset from February 2008 to December 2015. This dataset contained monthly median sold price for housing in California, Feb 2008-Dec 2016 monthly median mortgage rate, and Feb 2008-Dec 2016 monthly unemployment rate. Using this data, we attempted to predict median sold price using various time series methods.
